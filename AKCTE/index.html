					<h3>AP Computer Science</h3>
					<p>
						This is a college-level introductory course in computer science. Because the design and implementation of computer programs to solve problems involve skills that are fundamental to the study of computer science, a large part of the course is built around the development of computer programs that correctly solve a given problem. At the same time, the design and implementation of computer programs is used as a context for introducing other important aspects of computer science, including the development and analysis of algorithms, the development and use of fundamental data structures, the study of standard algorithms and typical applications, and the use of logic and formal methods. In addition, the responsible use of these systems is an integral part of the course.

					<h3>PLTW Civil Engineering and Architecture</h3>
					<p>
						In this specialization Project Lead the Way (PLTW) students answer the questions: How are things made? What processes go into creating products? Is the process for making a water bottle the same as it is for a musical instrument? How do assembly lines work? How has automation changed the face of manufacturing? As students find the answers to these questions, they learn about the history of manufacturing, a sampling of manufacturing processes, robotics and automation. The course is built around several key concepts: computer modeling, Computer Numeric Control (CNC) equipment, Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software, robotics, and flexible manufacturing systems.

					<h3>PLTW Engineering Design and Development</h3>
					<p>
						In this capstone Project Lead the Way (PLTW) students will work in teams to research, design, test and construct a solution to an open-ended engineering problem. The product development life cycle and a design process are used to guide and help the team to reach a solution to the problem. The team presents and defends their solution to a panel of outside reviewers at the conclusion of the course. The EDD course allows students to apply all the skills and knowledge learned in previous Project Lead the Way courses. The use of 3D design software helps students design solutions to the problem their team has chosen. This course also engages students in time management and teamwork skills, a valuable skill set for students in the future.
